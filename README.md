# Hi, I'm Faith Olopade

I am a Computer Science student at Trinity College
Dublin, passionate about applying technology to real-world problems.
My interests span AI systems, data analysis, cybersecurity, economics,
financial technologies, and technology policy and ethics.

I have gained industry experience through three Microsoft
internships and two Intel internships, where I focused on how data
and intelligent systems can support better decision making.

I am grateful to have received several awards and scholarships,
including:
- Web Summit Scholarship
- European Central Bank Scholarship
- Trinity College Dublin Gold Medal
- Prof. John G. Byrne Scholarship
- Intel Women in Technology Scholarship
- McLaren Racing NEXT Scholarship
- Huawei Seeds for the Future Scholarship

I enjoy research, building impactful systems, and contributing to
meaningful collaborative projects.
